AirBnB data to track their activities in  Seattle, Washington State was explored and visualized in Tableau to uncover insights about the operations
of AirBnB in the city.
## Data Source

## Data Processing
The data as downloaded from the website contained relevant columns in three different document. For ease in visualization on tableau,
the three seperate files were compiled in a single Excel workbook document on three seperate sheets. After a connection was establsihed 
to the data source in Tableau, an inner join was used to tie the three tables together based on their common column field and the data was ready for analysis and
visualization in Tableau.
